# XperiVerdict

**XperiVerdict** is a community-driven Sony Xperia firmware tracker that aggregates official updates, security patches, OS upgrades, and real-world stability intelligence in one place.

No marketing language. No speculation. Just firmware data, clearly and responsibly presented.

## What Problem Does This Solve?

Sony firmware updates are often:

- Distributed inconsistently across regions  
- Poorly documented  
- Accompanied by vague or incomplete changelogs  
- Difficult to compare across different models  

As a result, users are frequently left asking:

- Is this update stable?  
- What actually changed?  
- Is it worth installing right now?  

**XperiVerdict exists to answer these questions—clearly and transparently.**

---

## Key Features

- 📦 **Firmware tracking** by Xperia model and region  
- 🔐 **Security patch visibility**, including monthly patch level and OS version  
- 🧠 **Community intelligence** on stability, bugs, and performance  
- 🔎 **Fast filtering and search** across devices and firmware builds  
- 📱 **Mobile-friendly interface**, designed for modern usage  

---

## Who Is This For?

- Sony Xperia users who care about software updates  
- Power users who flash firmware or closely monitor releases  
- Developers, testers, and reviewers tracking Xperia changes  
- Anyone tired of vague *“system improvements”* changelogs  

If you do not own an Xperia device, this platform may not be relevant to you—and that is perfectly fine.
